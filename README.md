# Earthquake Classification

## Dataset

Dataset contains data about occurrences of earth quakes in a geographical region with meta data like time, magnitude, unique id, GPS, depth, location, source. It has about 53000 data points
 

## Features & Results

- Used KNN and Decision Trees to build a classifier for predicting labels as Magnitude(Mw) using appropriate features
- For a threshold T, for Mw < T, label becomes 0 (no earth- quake) and for Mw â‰¥ T becomes 1 (earthquake). T was found after analysis.
- Analysed by plotting ROC for both these classifiers for K as parameter in KNN and pre-prune depth as a parameter in Decision Tree
